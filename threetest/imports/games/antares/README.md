so, since introducing economy - even though really appealing - seems quite difficult, we will start with the "classic" Orion / Civilization model, but will use better Research gameplay + the whole Military system defined elsewhere - to start it off. Then we can add the economy at the next iteration.

### Base PoC - NO BACKING FROM CIV / ORION APPROACH!!!

Resources:

- Production
- Culture - NO for PoC, keeping it simple
- Money
- Food
- Energy
- Research, split into 2
- Shit, very wanting to put CMs into gameplay, it seems so logical:

colony ship has some in store, then we need to start producing in the industry sector. Maybe actually CMs are kinda Civ production, while our PDs are actually productivity of people? So that there's no PDs as a resource on the map - it only depends on people, robots, buildings?

INTERESTING

Luxury and Strategic resources (may be required by some buildings) - shall we make it expendable, to promote exploration? Asteroids etc?

Buildings: no fancy requirements, just PDs + potentially strategic resources
OPEX: only money and energy; maybe per sim??
Ok, maybe CMs as well - see above.

Ok, actually CE will have to be used as well eventually - but as a strategic resource of sorts, it's just it's being produced vs mined.

Terrain: NO weather etc for now (even though its cool...), just type of terrain with its specific resource outputs as usual.

Districts:
- Colony growing into Capital
- Habitation
- Industry
- Education & Research
- Healthcare
- Safety
- Financial
- Spaceport
- Special:
    - Resources (mining, farming, sea stuff)
    - Energy

#### Initial thoughts on buildings / districts

Colony: contains some CMs, houses up to 10 sims (needs to get Habitation upgrades to house more), starting # of sims - 1-5?, produces base PD, Money, Energy, Food

### Key resources -- ok here we again swithced into simulation mode, thats FUTURE!!! PARK IT FOR NOW

- PDs: production days, used for building "buildings"
- Culture: used for social developments as in Civ + generation of works of art, literature etc
- Energy: obvious, everything needs energy
- Money: still need to decide how to handle better than in existing games
- Research: split into PhD research and applied research, separate gameplay
- Food: ?
- CM: construction materials
- CE: computer equipment
- CL: Chemicals

Planets will have Districts and Buildings inside those districts, "improvements" will simply be type of District.

For PoC, NO SECTORS, buildings are planet wide.

Then, luxury and strategic resources like Civ.

Buildings have:

CAPEX: PDs (from ppl or robots) -- Money is calculated based on PDs!!!
CM, CE, CL
OPEX:
- CM, CE, CL, PD - baseline AND per sim
